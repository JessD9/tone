## Welcome to Teaching Online Effectively (TOnE)!

### Course Description
For the next eight weeks, we'll dive into some key ideas to help you design your course with flexibility in mind.  Whether you need to put your full course online this summer/fall, or you want to include more online elements in your campus course, we hope that this mini-course provides the information and resources you need.

Another key focus of our time together is to build a *Community of Inquiry* - a forum where we can share resources, experiences, and ideas about course design.

Our focus this time around will be on giving you some tools and competencies you can use to design and run your courses with asynchronicity in mind. We know that Zoom is uniquely fatiguing for both instructors and learners, so this course will model how to take the next step from a 'one-to-many' transmission model, to a 'many-to-many' transformational model of teaching and learning.

We have spread out the interactions in the course over eight weeks instead of four to provide you with a little more thinking space and time to consider what we offer. We will also reduce the emphasis on 'content' distribution in our synchronous meetings and instead share that asynchronously via our course blog at [multi-access.twu.ca/tone21](https://multi-access.twu.ca/tone21).
