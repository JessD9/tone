## Topic 2: Anatomy of an Online Course

Here is where we get into the nitty-gritty of what a course looks like!  Again, let me repeat that every course is different and may not have these elements.  

In the course planning BLUEPRINT, we outline the topics of the course, the learning outcomes for each topic, the assessments, and the resources. Sometimes we can plan out the formative learning activities, but often we add those throughout the unit writing process.

In this next section, we'll share what a typical unit looks like.

#### Section 1: Overview
We typically start with an overview of what is in the unit - what are the key ideas, how does it connect to the rest of the course, why does this matter to students, etc.  This is one way the instructor can connect to students, to set the stage for learning, and to really bring in your teacher’s voice or presence.  Many instructors use video to share the unit overview, as this can personalize the experience for students.

The Unit Overview also includes the unit Topics, Learning Outcomes, Activities, and Resources. We include these details want to allow students to plan their week, make time for activities and assessments, ensure they have the resources, and to know what the purpose is (learning outcomes).

**Learning Outcomes**
Learning outcomes describe what learners will be able to know, do and value after a learning experience. They clearly explain the knowledge, skills, and attitudes students will gain through a course.

It is crucial to have measurable learning outcomes listed on the course outline, as they communicate expectations to the learner and help guide the instructor.  We also encourage instructors to list the learning outcomes for each unit/lesson, as again, this helps students know what to aim for.

*Writing SMART Learning Outcomes*

The diagram above illustrates the five key principles in designing learning outcomes.  They must be specific and clear, instructors must be able to measure successful completion of an outcome, and learners must be able to achieve them.  Learning outcomes should also be relevant to the course and achievable  within the time period allotted.


**Activities and Assessments - Making Connections**
![](oaa.png)

Once you have decided the learning outcomes for a lesson, consider how students will demonstrate their learning (assessment).  Sometimes design starts with the assessment in mind, and then you can work backwards to examine what that assessment tells us about students learning.  Next, consider how to prepare learners for the assessments (through learning activities).

There should be clear connections between the outcomes, activities, and assessments.

**Bloom’s Taxonomy**

​Instructional designers often use Bloom’s Taxonomy to help write learning outcomes. The graphic below lists the possible verbs to use in a learning outcome, as well as examples of activities and/or assessments.  Just to give one example, if you are assessing the domain of analysis by asking student to compare, you may ask them to create and administer a survey.

**Significant Learning**

Fink (2003) described learning as change in the learner.  How can we tell what has changed in our students, or how the course has impacted them?
In his book, Creating Significant Learning Experiences: An Integrated Approach to Designing Colleges Courses, he asks instructors to consider what students will take away from the course.  What are the long-term goals?  What will they remember?
The image here shows Fink’s Taxonomy of Significant Learning.  Consider the various categories of learning as you write your outcomes.  Will students apply their learning?  Learn about themselves or others?  Value a new idea or perspective? Become a self-directed learner?

**SOLO Taxonomy**

Another great resource that can help guide your course design is the structure of observed learning outcomes (SOLO) created by John Biggs and K. Colis. Below are two images showing the 5 levels of understanding.
