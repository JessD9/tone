## Unit Learning Activities

We will dive more into these key components of a lesson, but for now, we want to emphasize the importance of making connections between these three elements.

Once you have decided the learning outcomes for a lesson/unit, consider how students will demonstrate their learning (assessment).  Sometimes design starts with the assessment in mind, and then you can work backwards to examine what that assessment tells us about students learning.  The other connection we need to make is how to prepare learners for the assessments through learning activities.

There should be clear connections between the outcomes, activities, and assessments in a course.
