## Topic 3: Ensuring Quality in Online Learning Design

What is a *quality online course*?  Take a moment to jot down some thoughts.


When we assess the quality of an online course, many course designers turn to the **[Quality Matters] rubric for Higher Education](https://www.qualitymatters.org/sites/default/files/PDFs/StandardsfromtheQMHigherEducationRubric.pdf)**.  Have a quick look at the link and we'll expand on the elements in a bit.  As you skim the sections, pay attention to the key feature of alignment.

! Unique to the QM Rubric is the concept of Alignment. This occurs when critical course components — Learning Objectives (Competencies) (2.1, 2.2), Assessment and Measurement (3.1), Instructional Materials (4.1), Learning Activities and Learner Interaction (5.1), and Course Technology (6.1) — work together to ensure students achieve desired learning outcomes. - *from [QM Course Design Rubric Standards] (https://www.qualitymatters.org/qa-resources/rubric-standards/higher-ed-rubric)*.

At TWU, we have slightly modified the rubric to align with our own Trinity standards of values for teaching and learning.

As you read the following guidelines, consider how you can incorporate them into your course design.
