### Portfolios

Portfolios, whether electronic or otherwise, are another common type of assessment in online courses.    

Clemson University (n.d.) categorizes portfolios into three main types:

1. **Showcase portfolio**: Highlights achievements
1. **Learning portfolio**: Demonstrates the learning process with a focus on feedback
1. **Assessment portfolio**: Used to assess studentsâ€™ competency on certain standards or topics

Scully et al. (2018) explains that in the university context, "learning portfolios are typically used with the dual intention of (i) encouraging critically self-reflective lifelong learning and (ii) gathering evidence of broad skills and competencies that may enhance future employment prospects" (p.iii).  The authors warn portfolios are only effective if instructors and learners understand the process of reflection. "Effortful design, explicit scaffolding and sufficient time are needed" (p.10).

If you've ever created a portfolio yourself, you know it takes a lot of reflection and critical thinking as you select evidence of your learning or achievements. An ePortfolio in particular adds an element of vulnerability, as learners share their successes and struggles openly. This is a great opportunity for peers to learn from each other about the process and products of learning.

Skim the resources in the activity below and consider whether portfolios will help your students demonstrate the learning outcomes for your course.
