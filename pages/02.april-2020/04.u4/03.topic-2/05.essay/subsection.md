### Essays, Projects, Interviews & Presentations

Here are a couple other common assessments.  What adjustments do you foresee for an online course?  
Here are some questions to consider:

- What does the 'drafting stage' look like for these projects?  Do you give formative feedback to students before they hand in their final project?
- What online tools can students use? (e.g. Google docs to collaborate, Zoom for presentations, etc.)
- Is there an opportunity for personalization or creativity in the way information is presented? (video, audio, images, etc.)

We're going to address a couple of these questions in our synchronous zoom sessions and later units, but let's discuss utilizing media in your assignments.

**Video Assessments**

Most students have access to a video recording device (their cell phones), so why not take advantage of that! Consider how you might use video assessments in your course. Students can record a video blog, interview a partner, show their field trip, demonstrate a procedure...the list goes on. Storytelling is a key feature of video assignments, so consider how students can connect the course content to their own personal or professional experience. Another way to use videos is for students to analyze videos online related to your course.

**Podcasts**
Podcasts can be another engaging alternative/addition to a typical essay, project, interview or presentation.  See the following sample assignment from a Trinity course, as well as the resources in the learning activity below.
