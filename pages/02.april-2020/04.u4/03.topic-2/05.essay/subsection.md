### Essays, Projects, & Interviews

Here are a couple other common assessments.  What adjustments do you foresee for an online course?  
Here are some questions to consider:

- What does the 'drafting stage' look like for these projects?  Do you give formative feedback to students before they hand in their final project?
- What online tools can students use? (e.g. Google docs to collaborate, Zoom for presentations, etc.)
- How do I prevent cheating and plagiarism in student writing?

We're going to address a couple of these questions in our synchronous zoom sessions and later units.  For now, check out the resources for some tips on these issues.
