## Topic 2: Activity & Assessment Ideas

This topic is all about exploration and sharing.  We'll present a number of engaging learning activities with a range of purposes:
- First and foremost, the learning activity must align with your course/unit learning outcomes
- They should also connect to assessments, allowing learners to practice and prepare for assignments
- In addition to your listed learning outcomes, there may be other skills the activities promote including: collaboration, critical and creative thinking, quantitative and qualitative reasoning, communication, research, and information literacy.

As you explore the ideas and the links provided in this unit, you are encouraged to add your comments, ideas, experiences to our shared chalkboard.

Please let us know what activities/assignments have worked well in your class, or which you would like to try.  Perhaps share a link to a google doc of assignment instructions, or add a picture/screenshot of the activity.  This is our opportunity to develop our **Community of Practice** - to share resources, experiences, and encouragement.

In the next several pages, we're going to explore 10 common activity/assessment types in online courses.

!! Please note that not all of these activity and assessment types will work for your course!  Focus on what will help students practice and achieve the learning outcomes.

A final note...
In [Engaging Adult Learners: Philosophy, Principles and Practices](http://northernc.on.ca/leid/docs/engagingadultlearners.pdf) Jim Bryson suggest 5 questions when choosing activities/assessments:  

! o Are the instructions, the purpose and the intended learning outcome(s) for this activity clear enough to be correctly understood by all students?
! o Is this activity fair? Will all students be able to understand and participate in it as a learning exercise? What choices do they have? Is it related to course content and laid out in a logical manner?
! o Will this activity add to my students' interest in content? Will they find it engaging and motivating? Will it stimulate curiosity and participation?
! o Is this activity relevant to the intended learning outcomes for the course? Is it relevant to student expectations? To my instructional goals?
! o Have I provided support for success in terms of information, curriculum content, discussion, interaction, activities and available resources?

As you decide what activities/assessments are appropriate for your course, refer back to these questions.
