### Reflective Journals, Discussions, & Blogs

Have you experienced passive learners?  Those students who may sit in your class, read their texts, hand in assignments, but aren't really engaged in their learning?  Imagine now a more self-directed online course, where those same students get to *choose* whether to study the resources presented; they *choose* whether to listen to your video lectures, engage in online discussion forums, complete ungraded learning activities...how do you motivate these students to become **ACTIVE** learners?

One strategy that helps students become not only active learners, but reflective learners, is to promote **Reflective Learning**.  This can be a part of several assignment types, but for now, let's focus on the common **Reflective Journals, Discussion Forums, & Online Blogs**.  These assignments can be structured with specific questions (related to the learning outcomes), or unstructured, allowing the learner to explore and reflect in their own way.  

#### Reflective Journals
Reflective Journals are common graded assignments, but they can also be used as ungraded learning activities to promote note-taking, reflection, critical thinking, etc.  

For example, in some of our online courses we often have this note for students when we explain the ungraded learning activities in a unit:

!! Note that the learning activities in this course are ungraded, unless specified. You are strongly encouraged to complete them, as they are designed to help you succeed in your course assessments. You are encouraged to write your responses in a **Reflective Learning Journal** and refer back to your notes as you complete your assignments.

Here are some other sample instructions we use in our online courses:

Sample 1: **Introduction to the Reflective Journal**
!!!! A reflective journal is simply a record of your thoughts. It is a reflection of the way you think and the manner in which you respond to your learning. Journals can consist of traditional note taking, mind maps, pictures, stream-of-consciousness writing, recordings, quotes, sketches, or drawings: whatever you choose to include. Experiment and have fun.  
!!!! The purpose of journaling is to make you an active participant in your learning experiences as you engage in the various activities throughout the course’s readings, activities, and discussions with your instructor and your fellow students. Reflecting upon these learning events will help you gain a deeper understanding of the course materials and help integrate your learning into applied practice in your everyday life and work.  
!!!! Throughout the course, we will remind you to write in your journal, as we want to be sure you are actively learning the material. To assist you, we have provided you with questions you can ask yourself in order to get your creative energies flowing. Reflective journaling is an activity you can and should complete on a regular or daily basis, even outside of our scheduled course activities.

Sample 2: **Journal Instructions**
!!! Note that for this course, you will keep a **Reflective Learning Journal**, which will provide the basis for many of your assignments. Writing can be a powerful learning experience, as we engage in reflection and critical analysis of the new concepts we discover. Through regular writing, we are challenged to think critically, integrate these new concepts with our prior understanding, and apply to other contexts.

!!! As you read and watch the resources in this unit, consider the following questions:   
!!! 1. In your Reflective Learning Journal, write a **summary sentence** for each major idea/concept that relates to your understanding of what it means to be a transformational leader.     
!!! 1. Choose the concept that most resonates with you and write a **short paragraph summary** of this concept, applied to your professional/personal context.   
!!! 1. Formulate **one question** that emerged from this reading that you will explore and consider in future course readings and assignments.   
!!! As you prepare your assignments, refer to these notes.

Sample 3: **Journal Instructions**
! Answer the following questions in your Reflective Journal:
! 1. What terms were the most important concepts of this week's lesson? Be sure to define any important terms in your own words. (2 paragraphs)
! 2. What was your muddiest point (that is, what did not make sense)? (1 paragraph).
! 3. What would you like to know more about from this lesson, and why? (1 paragraph)
! 4. How does this lesson relate to something you have already learned outside of this class? (1 paragraph)
! 5. Why do you think you were required to learn this content? (1 paragraph)             


For more samples of journals used on TWU online courses, see the following [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M1NUHmYRY3jPIu0BWeVI5T7sFRasUmAkkYRsO_6DHik/edit?usp=sharing).

#### Discussions Forums
Discussion forums are a popular form of assessment for online courses.  Which means, if students are taking several online courses at once...there is a certain amount of forum fatigue they may experience!  Be sure to craft your discussion questions in a way that meets the unit learning outcomes, but also inspires collaboration, inquiry, and critical thinking.
In the activity below there are several resources and guides for facilitating discussions. In particular, pay attention to the various activity types you can have in discussion forums.  Here are some sample activities from University of Texas: [Generating and Facilitating Engaging and Effective Online Discussions](https://facultyinnovate.utexas.edu/sites/default/files/Effective-Online-Discussions.pdf)
1. **Web Field Trips**: Instructor provides a link or a series of links. Students follow the link(s) and report back through an instructor-defined set of questions.
1. **Brainstorming**: Students set forth a series of ideas on a given topic without evaluation.
1. **Problem-Solving**: Small groups work out a solution to a problem.
1. **Writing Groups**: Students work together in groups of four or five to share drafts and provide peer response and peer-editing.
1. **Case Analysis**: Students work independent on a common case followed by group analysis in the board.
1. **Collaborative Writing**: Workgroups work together to create a single document – proposals and analytical reports work well – which they then post to the larger group for critique.
1. **Cooperative Debate**: Workgroups present perspectives on a particular issue, followed by a whole group consensus-building discussion.
1. **Discussions of Course Readings**: Instructor creates threaded discussions
around assigned readings. Threads may include pre-reading (anticipation) activities, interpretations, evaluations, etc.
1. **Research Bank**: Students and instructor contribute links and citations to a common area for a classwide research topic.



#### Blogs

A similar reflective learning tool is a blog.  It may take some courage for some students to post their thoughts online (and for faculty to step out of Moodle), but it can be very effective in helping students demonstrate their learning.

Blogs can be kept private.  Students can share their link with their instructor, or post their link on Moodle so other students can see.  It's important to go over privacy considerations with students, as well as [netiquette guidelines](http://teach.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/NetiquetteGuideforOnlineCourses.pdf)

Here are some benefits to consider from [How Do Blogs Support Learning?](https://resources.depaul.edu/teaching-commons/teaching-guides/technology/other-teaching-tools/Pages/blogs.aspx)
- **Blogs help grow learning communities** by allowing students to share their own perspectives and experiences while learning about those of their classmates.
- **Blogs let students take ownership of their learning**, offering them a space to tease out tough problems, explore possible solutions, and basically do the hard work that critical thinking requires.
- **Blogs encourage creativity of expression** by giving students a platform to experiment with a variety of genres, allowing for the unique personalities of both students and faculty to emerge.
- **Blogs create multimodal spaces capable of hosting a wide variety of multimedia**: oftentimes images, audio, video, and other media can communicate ideas more effectively than written text.
- **Blogs give students opportunities to address audiences other than their professors:** their posts could be read by other students, their parents, and visitors from across the globe.
- **Blogs foster opportunities for reflection** and provide them with tangible evidence of their learning over time: students can look at their previous posts to identify recurrent patterns in their thinking, times of change or growth, and other markers of learning and development.
- **Blogs familiarize students with widely-used web content platforms**: The knowledge and skills gained by writing and maintaining a blog are transferrable to a wide variety of work contexts, as blogging platforms (particularly Wordpress) power an increasing number of websites around the world.

Tony Bates also promotes blogs as he discussing [Open pedagogy](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/teachinginadigitalagev2/chapter/11-4-open-pedagogy/) in *Teaching in a Digital Age*.  He quotes Hegarty (2015), in describing eight attributes of open pedagogy. Consider how your class blogs can impact more than just your class.

- **participatory technologies**: socially constructed media such as blogs, wikis and other ‘sharing’ social media;
people, openness and trust: students’ willingness to learn is fragile, with participation and interactions unlikely to flourish unless an element of trust can be built (Mak et., 2010);
- **innovation and creativity**: finding new models of teaching and learning that better exploit OER and more emphasis on choosing digital technologies and methods that encourage the sharing of knowledge and resources;
- **sharing ideas and resources**: an open pedagogy needs peers to share willingly within a connected and trusting and professional community;
- **connected community**: a technologically linked community with common interests;
- **learner-generated**: this requires ‘opening up’ the process to empower students to take the lead, solve problems, and work collectively to produce artifacts that they share, discuss, reconfigure, and redeploy
- **reflective practice**: when students and teachers collaborate in partnerships, it facilitates deeper pedagogical reflection
- **peer review**: Conole (2014) sees learners as publishers and users of a range of open tools, with peer interactions and critique embedded in the learning experience.
