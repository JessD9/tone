### Blogs & Journals

Have you experienced passive learners?  Those students who may sit in your class, read their texts, hand in assignments, but aren't really engaged in their learning?  Imagine now a more self-directed online course, where those same students get to *choose* whether to study the resources presented; they *choose* whether to listen to your video lectures, engage in online discussion forums, complete ungraded learning activities...how do you motivate these students to become **ACTIVE** learners?

One strategy that helps students become not only active learners, but reflective learners, is to promote **Reflective Learning**.  This typically comes in the form of a learning journal, learning log, or online blog.  It can be structured with specific questions (related to the learning outcomes), or unstructured, allowing the learner to explore and reflect in their own way.  These activities can be graded or ungraded.  

For example, in some of our online courses we often have this note for students when we explain the ungraded learning activities in a unit:

!! Note that the learning activities in this course are ungraded, unless specified. You are strongly encouraged to complete them, as they are designed to help you succeed in your course assessments. You are encouraged to write your responses in a **Reflective Learning Journal** and refer back to your notes as you complete your assignments.

Here are some other sample instructions we use in our online courses:

Sample 1: **Introduction to the Reflective Journal**
!!!! A reflective journal is simply a record of your thoughts. It is a reflection of the way you think and the manner in which you respond to your learning. Journals can consist of traditional note taking, mind maps, pictures, stream-of-consciousness writing, recordings, quotes, sketches, or drawings: whatever you choose to include. Experiment and have fun.  
!!!! The purpose of journaling is to make you an active participant in your learning experiences as you engage in the various activities throughout the courseâ€™s readings, activities, and discussions with your instructor and your fellow students. Reflecting upon these learning events will help you gain a deeper understanding of the course materials and help integrate your learning into applied practice in your everyday life and work.  
!!!! Throughout the course, we will remind you to write in your journal, as we want to be sure you are actively learning the material. To assist you, we have provided you with questions you can ask yourself in order to get your creative energies flowing. Reflective journaling is an activity you can and should complete on a regular or daily basis, even outside of our scheduled course activities.

Sample 2: **Journal Instructions**
!!! Note that for this course, you will keep a **Reflective Learning Journal**, which will provide the basis for many of your assignments. Writing can be a powerful learning experience, as we engage in reflection and critical analysis of the new concepts we discover. Through regular writing, we are challenged to think critically, integrate these new concepts with our prior understanding, and apply to other contexts.

!!! As you read and watch the resources in this unit, consider the following questions:   
!!! :fa-pencil: In your Reflective Learning Journal, write a **summary sentence** for each major idea/concept that relates to your understanding of what it means to be a transformational leader.     
!!! :fa-pencil: Choose the concept that most resonates with you and write a **short paragraph summary** of this concept, applied to your professional/personal context.   
!!! :fa-pencil: Formulate **one question** that emerged from this reading that you will explore and consider in future course readings and assignments.   
!!! :fa-pencil: As you prepare your assignments, refer to these notes.

Sample 3: **Journal Instructions**
! Answer the following questions in your Reflective Journal:
! 1. What terms were the most important concepts of this week's lesson? Be sure to define any important terms in your own words. (2 paragraphs)
! 2. What was your muddiest point (that is, what did not make sense)? (1 paragraph).
! 3. What would you like to know more about from this lesson, and why? (1 paragraph)
! 4. How does this lesson relate to something you have already learned outside of this class? (1 paragraph)
! 5. Why do you think you were required to learn this content? (1 paragraph)
