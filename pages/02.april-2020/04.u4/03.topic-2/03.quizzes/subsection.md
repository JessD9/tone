### Quizzes

Test, exams, quizzesâ€¦these are essential to many courses, however, there is definitely an art to designing an effective and fair test. An what about online tests?  How do we prevent students from cheating...or confirm the identity of the test-taker?  Several questions arise when designing tests for online courses.  First, let's pause and consider the use and effectiveness of formative, ungraded tests.

In our online courses, we think about the assessments and whether students have enough guidance and practice.  For low-level memorization of key terms for example, you could create flashcards or quizzes (e.g. matching, fill-in-the blank, multiple choice, etc.).  Yes, it may take some time to create, but our online team can help you! Once we receive the terms and definitions from instructors we typically use [h5P](https://h5p.org/content-types-and-applications), an open source application that seamlessly integrates into Moodle (and other websites).

Here are some examples from our courses:

[h5p id="29"]

[h5p id="55"]

[h5p id="18"]


Note that H5P is an application in Moodle, so you can create your own quizzes and use it for graded assessments.
