## Topic 1: Formative and Summative Assessment

Assessment demonstrates whether, and to what degree, the learner has met the learning outcomes for the course. This traditionally comes in the form of a test or essay, but there are a number of other ways we can measure students’ understanding. First, let’s focus on what assessment is.

### Understanding Assessment
Assessment can be *for, of,* and *as* learning.

! **Assessment for Learning**, a type of formative assessment, is utilized by teachers in order to gain an understanding of their students' knowledge and skills in order to guide instruction.

!!! **Assessment as learning**, as previously mentioned, is also a formative assessment which focuses on teaching students' the metacognitive processes to evaluate their own learning and make adjustments.

!!!! **Assessment of Learning** is a summative assessment used primarily to compare students and report progress according to Earl (2003). Unit tests are a commonly used form of Assessment of Learning.

In our courses, we often think first of the **summative assessments** – the final test, unit quiz, essay, etc. that sums of students' knowledge.  These assessments allow students to demonstrate their learning of the course and we give them a final grade.

**Formative assessments** involve giving feedback and helping students learn from the assessment.  This ‘forms’ students knowledge so they can further show their understanding of a topic.  For example, a practice quiz before a final exam.  A peer review of an essay before the final paper. Student journals, 1 minute papers, muddiest point, and a number of other activities to help students and instructors assess learning before being graded.

| Frame of Reference | Sometimes normative (comparing each student against all others); sometimes criterion | Always criterion (evaluating students according to the same criteria) |


### Learning Activities - Formative, ungraded, MESSY Learning!
In our online courses, we often include learning activities. These are typically ungraded so that learners can practice the key concepts/questions and get *messy* with their learning.  Learning is a process, and activities allow for students to work through questions, organize their learning, explore solutions, and prepare for assessments.

*Questions to Consider:*
:fa-question:  Before you move on to the learning activity, take a moment to jot down your thoughts on these questions:
- Why do we assess?  
- How do I assess my students?  
- Are there opportunities for students to practice what they are learning before an assessment?
- Do I give formative feedback that will help students be more successful in future assignments?
- How do I design learning experiences that facilitate discovery, exploration, questioning, etc.?
