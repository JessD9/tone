#### Activity 4.1: Assessment of Learning

:fa-question:  Take a moment to jot down your thoughts on these questions:
- Why do we assess?  
- How do I assess my students?  
- Are there opportunities for students to practice what they are learning before an assessment?
- Do I give formative feedback that will help students be more successful in future assignments?


:fa-book: Next, read section 6.8 [Assessment of learning](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/teachinginadigitalagev2/chapter/5-8-assessment-of-learning/) from our course text.
