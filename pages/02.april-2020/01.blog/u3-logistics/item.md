### Welcome to Unit 3!

You have likely noticed by now that this unit looks a bit different from the previous two units, and that is by design. Our intent in shifting to a different format is to show you different formats and course structures in multi-access learning environments.

This unit will demonstrate one way to reduce your reliance on web-conferencing (Zoom, BlueJeans, Skype...) when providing direct instruction for learners in your course. As we have all experienced as we finished the Spring 2020 semester, web-conferencing is exhausting! It is not a good replacement for a lecture, it is difficult for instructors, and it is difficult for learners. For some learners (and instructors), it is impossible due to sketchy or limited bandwidth internet connections at home, or to extreme differences in time-zones.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Creating video content for your students? We have always said shorter is better, but in this time of uncertainty many students dont have decent access to the internet. So split your presentations into parts. Easier for students to watch with little to no bandwidth. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/tru?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#tru</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/covid19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#covid19</a></p>&mdash; Jon Fulton (@jozbfz) <a href="https://twitter.com/jozbfz/status/1246575942056546304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 4, 2020</a></blockquote>  

Web-conferencing certainly helped get us through March and April, so this is not to denigrate those who needed it, but it is important to recognize that March and April 2020 in higher ed were far less than ideal.

So for this week, we are going to focus on a primarily asynchronous, low-bandwidth mode of communication supplemented with more casual and unstructured synchronous meetings.

Below this post, you will see what is called a 'feed' which is essentially a subscription to a blog. Each time I publish a post (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday mornings), that post will show up at the top of the feed. Each post will outline some new content and resources for that topic.

!!!! If you have your own blog and would like to respond to the reflection prompts for this week on your own blog, send me the URL and I will create another feed of participant posts.
