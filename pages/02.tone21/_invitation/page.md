Hello everyone!

We are grateful for the questions that we have received recently regarding the Fall 2020 semester and TWU's emphasis on Multi-Access Learning as a teaching model. In response, we have developed a mini-course called Teaching ONline Effectively (TOnE) to help you think about and design the scenarios that we will be attending to in the Fall semester.

The course is designed intentionally to develop and nurture a Community of Reflection and Practice (CORP) and connect you with colleagues (inside and outside your department) who are working on many of the same issues as you will be. This structure of learning pods is a high impact teaching practice that we hope you will implement in your own courses.

Here is an outline of the schedule that we intend to follow, beginning Tuesday, May 19, after the long weekend, and continuing for four weeks.

### Plenary meetings (11:00 am-12:00 noon):
Tues May 19 - Design Principles and Learner Contexts
Mon May 25 - Activities and Assessments
Mon June 01 - Building Community and Learning Pods
Mon June 08 - Emergent Session

### Learning Pods
During the week and at times that are suitable for your group, you are encouraged to meet synchronously to discuss your individual questions and challenges.

### Tech Talks (Fridays @ 11:00-11:30am)
May 22 - Moodle Set Up and Gradebook
May 29 - Zoom and Microsoft Stream
June 5 - Web-based Learning Activities
June 12 - Library Resources: Curriculum Builder, Virtual Labs and Research Resources

If you can't make the synchronous plenary sessions, don't worry! We will be modeling Multi-Access by recording and making sessions available after the fact, including transcripts for those in low-bandwidth situations.

Please join our next ‘TOnE’ – Teaching Online Effectively session. We are pleased to invite you all to the course to participate as much as you are able during these challenging times.
