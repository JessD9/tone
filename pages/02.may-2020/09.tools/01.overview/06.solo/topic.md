### SOLO Taxonomy

In light of the presumptive goal of higher order cognitive activities, the SOLO Taxonomy is a tool that can be used to evaluate the quality of a given learner's or group's response to a provocation. SOLO is an acronym for Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome, and it defines various levels of responses, as follows.

Here is another conceptualization of the SOLO Taxonomy:

If learners are providing responses at a `pre- or uni-structural` level in a university course, they are going to have a bad time. `Multi-structural` responses will likely lead to grades in the 'C' range. At minimum, responses should be `unambiguously relational` for a grade in the 'B' range and `extended abstract` for a grade in the 'A' range.

The [TWU Standard Grading System describes 'A' work as](https://www.twu.ca/about/university-standard-grading-system)

>Outstanding, excellent work; exceptional performance with strong evidence of original thinking, good organization, meticulous concern for documented evidence, and obvious capacity to analyze, synthesize, evaluate, discern, justify, and elaborate; frequent evidence of both verbal eloquence and perceptive insight in written expression; excellent problem-solving ability in scientific or mathematical contexts with virtually no computational errors; demonstrated masterful grasp of subject matter and its implications. Gives evidence of an extensive and detailed knowledge base. (Note: The A+ grade is reserved for very rare students of exceptional intellectual prowess and accomplishment, especially in lower level courses.)

For a 'B', here is what learners need to do:

> Good, competent work; laudable performance with evidence of some original thinking, careful organization; satisfactory critical and analytical capacity; reasonably error-free expository written expression, with clear, focused thesis and well-supported, documented, relevant arguments; good problem-solving ability, with few computational or conceptual errors in scientific subjects; reasonably good grasp of subject matter but an occasional lack of depth of discernment; evidence of reasonable familiarity with course subject matter, both concepts and key issues. Exhibits a serious, responsible engagement with the course content.

### Ummm...I'm here for the tools...

We're getting there. First, though, it is important to think about what affordances are provided by a particular tool that lead to learner progress towards outcomes. Does the tool
