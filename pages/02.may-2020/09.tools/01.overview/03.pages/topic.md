title: 'Privacy and Security'

Some 'free' software is not 'free'. There are relevant differences between 'free speech', 'free lunch', and 'free puppies'.

FLOSS is more akin to free speech, where the user has genuine agency in the exercise, while most 'free' tools are more like free lunches or those 'free cruises' that sucker so many people into giving up far more money, time, and effort than they first realize. Tools like Google Docs are easy to use, but the data that they collect for the purpose of selling us things and ideas that we neither need nor want is an egregious invasion of privacy for us and our learners.

As the adage goes...
> If a digital tool is free [and not FLOSS], then it is not the product, you are the product.
