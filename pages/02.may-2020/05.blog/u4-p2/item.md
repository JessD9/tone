It is likely that you have encountered and may believe that there is a distinction between digital 'natives' and 'immigrants'.

===

The essential argument is that *kids these days* have changed in that they have this innate ability to use and learn technology because they have grown up using technology, and those of us whose formative years pre-date the advent of the internet are forever at a disadvantage compared to the *kids*. You can read a bit more about the idea on Wikipedia, linked below. There is also a link in that article to Prensky's original article.

Aside from the problematic framing of learners as kids, there are some distinct challenges with the idea of digital literacy being a fixed trait rather than a matter of comfort, familiarity, and a skill that can be practiced and learned. It is no secret that more young people are comfortable using social media apps like TikTok, Instagram, SnapChat, Weibo, WeChat, and the like, but that does not mean that those people are more able to learn technology than older people or that they have an innate ability to do so. Have you ever asked a 1st-year university student to create a spreadsheet to create a budget or a gradebook with embedded formulae? It is more likely than not, that you will encounter a distinct lack of skill in completing this task.

### Residents and Visitors

I'd like to introduce you to a different way to conceptualize your relationship with digital media, and that is that you may be a *visitor* in some web spaces and a *resident* in others. Places on the web where you might be a visitor are those places where you, quite literally, visit, but importantly, don't leave a public trace of your time there. You don't spend any time interacting with people, but rather, you take a rather utilitarian approach by visiting a site, doing a thing, and leaving.

Alternately, there are places and spaces on the web, where *you* reside, where you interact, socialize, and leave traces of yourself online. For some, that may be Facebook, where you keep in touch with friends and family, or maybe it's a listserv you subscribed to back in the 90s, or your blog, or someone else's blog or social site. The important distinction is that these are places where you connect with other people; where you are socially *present*.

At the same time, if we can imagine the visitor <--> resident continuum on a horizontal axis, there is also a personal <--> professional continuum on a vertical axis, leading to 4 quadrants where you might situate your technology use.

The video below explains a process to help you think about where you reside on the web (7 mins).
